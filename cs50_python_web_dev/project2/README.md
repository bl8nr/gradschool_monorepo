### Project Description
This project is a chat application that allows users to have a display name and join and create chat channels. Users can chat in each individual chanel with other users also in that same channel. Users can also change their display name in real time.

### File LIst and Descriptions
- application.py
    - Flask application entry point. This is the only server python file and contains all the server app logic
- README.md
    - Contains project description, checklist and other project information
- requirements.txt
    - Describes the dependencies required by this project
- static/all.css
    - File generated by flask-assets that includes all the SCSS files (currently only one right now though) processed into one CSS file
- static/packed.js
    - File generated by flask-assets that includes all the JS files processed into one JS file
- static/js/chat.js
    - JS file that includes the main client side application logic
- static/js/helpers.js
    - JS file that includes all of the Handlebar helpers created for this project
- static/js/selectors.js
    - JS file that includes all of the JQuery selectors used to target HTML dom elements in this project

### Notes For Grading
For my last project I tried to make it in a more scaleable method, separating different categories of logic into different files based on the objects used. For this project I wanted to try to make the project code as concise as possible while still fully functional with a personal touch feature. After many refactors and design changes, I was pretty happy to see I achieved all the project requirements with less than 300 lines of main JS app code and less than 200 lines of python server code. I built this as a single page app using handlebars. To create a new channel, click the "New Channel" button in the left sidebar.

### Personal Touch
My personal touch for this app was giving the user the ability to change their display name and have that new name reflected in all clients in real time. This is a relatively simple feature to the user but called for a more advanced design (more use of UIDs) than what the apps core functionality required. To change your display name, click the "Change Display Name" link in the top right corner of the app.
