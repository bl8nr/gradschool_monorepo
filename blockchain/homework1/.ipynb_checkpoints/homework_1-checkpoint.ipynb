    "> This question is referring to the wallets \"private key.\" This reason this must always be kept secret is because this is the key used to sign transactions and that signature is the only thing used to prove the authenticity of a transaction in the blockchain. So, if someone was to get your wallets private key, they could transfer bitcoin to any other address/wallet they like and the cryptocurrency network would see it as a valid transaction of which there is nothing you can do to invalidate/reverse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. What is the difference between Encrypting and Digital Signing a Document? (Hint: Look at the\n",
    "cryptography page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography )\n",
    "\n",
    "> The major difference is that the purpose of encryption is to protect the contents of a document by making it unreadable by anyone without the correct key while the purpose of digital signatures is to prove the authenticity of a specific document. Signatures are derived from the contents of a document too, which essentally makes the document immutable since if the document is changed then the provided signature would become invalid. In short, encryption protects the contents of a message while signatures prove the authenticity of a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4a\\. What property do all encryption schemes share? They are focused on an operation that is easy to\n",
    "perform yet hard to ________. (Hint: Think of multiplying to large prime numbers. This process is easy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...yet hard to reverse. The concept being referred to here is prime factorization where you can easily multiple two prime numbers to get another number that is extremley difficult to factor (reverse) to find its original two multiplied prime values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Pretend I have 1M Bitcoins. Why won't the blockchain believe that? The blockchain will not believe\n",
    "that because of the ________ transaction model.\n",
    "Hint: Source of Answer: https://blockonomi.com/utxo-vs-account-based-transaction-models/\n",
    "\n",
    "> You cant really claim you have any ammount of Bitcoin due to the fact that Bitcoin uses the utxo transaction model. When you spend Bitcoin you're referring to previous transactions' output that you have the right to \"spend\" as \"your money/Bitcoin.\" These inputs and outputs are essentially chained from the original mining of the coin, through previous transactions all the way up to the point up in time where you want to spend it (as an input into another transaction). You never really \"own\" Bitcoin. A better description would be that you own the right to choose the next transaction the Bitcoin will be put into. Rather you \"control\" Bitcoin as opposed to \"owning\" it."
